<h1>Services Using and Supporting Roundcube</h1>

<p>
    There are literally thousands of services that make use of Roundcube to provide
    webmail to millions of users. We love to see our application in so many hands
    and believe it is essential for society at large to have Open Source software
    available for a crucial task such as communication.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a list of services that not only use, but actively contribute to
    Roundcube and where usage of those services helps to improve and further develop
    Roundcube webmail. These are the services that make it possible for us to
    continue improving our software and to make it freely available for everybody.
    Preferring one of these services will help them to further support us.
