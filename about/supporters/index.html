<h1>Services Using and Supporting Roundcube</h1>

<p class="bodytext">
There are literally thousands of services that make use of Roundcube to provide 
webmail to millions of users. We love to see our application in so many hands
and believe it is essential for society at large to have Open Source software 
available for a crucial task such as communication.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Below is a list of services that not only use, but actively contribute to 
Roundcube and where usage of those services helps to improve and further develop
Roundcube webmail. These are the services that make it possible for us to 
continue improving our software and to make it freely available for everybody.
Preferring one of these services will help them to further support us.</p>
