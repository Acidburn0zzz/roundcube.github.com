<h1>How to Contribute</h1>

<div class="bodytext">

<p>Want to help make Roundcube the best webmail solution ever? Roundcube is developed and licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">Gnu GPL</a> open source license. Our developers and
contributors are all volunteers and we're always looking for new additions and resources.</p>

The Roundcube <a href="http://lists.roundcube.net/dev">development mailing list</a> is the place where ongoing development is discussed.
This mailing list is not a support forum, and requests for help with non-development related problems will not be answered there.
Thanks for keeping the list on-topic and productive!</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>Be sure that we test the code before we release it. However, you might find something that isn't right.
To report bugs please use our <a href="http://trac.roundcube.net/report">tracking system</a> but read
<a href="http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Howto_ReportIssues">these instructions</a> before opening a new ticket.
And remember: the more information we get the easier we can reproduce and fix it.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>Roundcube webmail is written in PHP and JavaScript (and of course HTML and CSS).

In order to start translating, you have to become a member of the translation team for your language.
