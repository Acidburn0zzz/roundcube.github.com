tags: releases updates

As a follow-up to the recent security update for the stable versions 1.2. and 1.1, this new release fixes a regression that sneaked in with the IMAP command injection protection which unintentionally disabled actions that operate on all selected messages (e.g. mark all as junk).

We recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube 1.2.8. and 1.1.11 with these new versions.

* [release 1.2.9](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.2.9).
* [release 1.1.12](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.1.12).
