The [Roundcube Plugin Repository](https://plugins.roundcube.net) which currently hosts over 100 plugins for Roundcube Webmail as recently been freshen up with new versions of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Packagist](https://github.com/composer/packagist) and [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and is now running with PHP7 on a brand new server kindly sponsored by [XS4All](https://www.xs4all.nl). The new site also has Grade A SSL support to guarantee authenticity.

With this upgrade, we also moved the platform out of the Beta state as it has proven to be a great extension to the Roundcube microcosmos. In case you developed a plugin and it's not yet listed in our repository, please read the [how to submit plugins](https://plugins.roundcube.net/about) today.

We'd like to thank all the great free software projects from Nginx and PHP to Composer and Packagist as well as successful IT companies caring about open source like XS4All and GlobalSign to make this all happen.
