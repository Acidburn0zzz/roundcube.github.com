We just published another update to the both stable versions 1.2 and 1.1 delivering 
important bug fixes and improvements which we picked from the upstream branch.

Included is a fix for a recently reported security XSS issue with CSS styles inside
an SVG tag (CVE-2017-6820).

See the full changelog for 1.2.4 in the [wiki](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog#release-124).
And for version 1.1.8 in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.1.8).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from GitHub via [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
