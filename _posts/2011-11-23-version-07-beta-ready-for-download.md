The development team is proud to announce the next beta release with new features, fixes and improvements under the hood. We re-implemented the entire message caching to make mail reading even faster than before. The message list now supports priority headers and the integrated spell checker has gained some options and personal dictionaries. Last but not least one can now save searches in the address book. And of course lots of bug fixes and small improvements are included to increase the fun working with Roundcube.

For a complete list of changes see [trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog)

We recommend to install and test this beta version on a separate environment until we have polished the stable release.
