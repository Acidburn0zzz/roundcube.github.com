The big change was carried out successfully and we're back in business :-) The CVS repository and the tracker at SourceForge are finally closed. If you'd like to report a bug, please use our new Tracker at [trac.roundcube.net.](http://trac.roundcube.net.) Also the annoying delays of the public CVS are past times. Anonymous checkouts from the new SVN repository can be done at any time and you'll surely get the freshest data. Last but not least, we also have a Wiki available for all sorts of information about RoundCube. Check it out!
