After a long period of development and some major changes in the project organization, we finally released version 0.1-beta2. New features like message search, spellchecking, saving messages as draft and folder renaming are introduced with this release.

It's recommended to replace your current copy of RoundCube (don't forget to backup) with this new release. The database structure did not change, what should make it even easier to upgrade.
