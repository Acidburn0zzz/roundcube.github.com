For the upcoming version 0.4 of Roundcube Webmail we have done some refactoring of the backend code which improves both performance and reliability of the application. These changes now need to be well tested before we continue to implement new features like threaded message listing planned for the 0.4 release.

This is where we need your help! Please download the latest nightly build (r3325) from [nightly.roundcube.net](http://nightly.roundcube.net/) and install it in parallel to your running systems. Test it with your configuration and all the different IMAP servers. As usual you are kindly requested to report problems to our bug tracking system at [trac.roundcube.net](http://trac.roundcube.net)

A list of already fixed bugs and improvements can be found in the CHANGELOG file within the release package.
