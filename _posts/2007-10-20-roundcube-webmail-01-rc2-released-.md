The second release candidate has just been released. This new version comes up with a lot of improvements and fixed bugs. An HTML message composition is also included but disabled by default because it's still experimental.

It's recommended to replace your current copy of RoundCube (don't forget to backup) with this new release. Read the UPGRADING instructions to see what needs to be done.

Enjoy!
