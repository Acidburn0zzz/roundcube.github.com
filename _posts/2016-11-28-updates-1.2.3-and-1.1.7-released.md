title: Updates 1.2.3 and 1.1.7 released
tags: releases updates security
---

We just published another update to the both stable versions 1.2 and 1.1 delivering 
important bug fixes and improvements which we picked from the upstream branch.

Included is a fix for a recently reported security issue when using PHP's 
`mail()` function. It has been discovered by Robin Peraglie using 
[RIPS](https://www.ripstech.com/) and more details along with a CVE number 
will be pulished shortly.

See the full changelog for 1.2.3 in the [wiki](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog#release-123).
Version 1.1.7 is a security update fixing the `mail()` issue and thus only relevant to
Roundcube installations not having an SMTP server configured for mail delivery.

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from GitHub via [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
