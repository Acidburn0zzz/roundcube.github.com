Still amazed by the enormous interest in this project, I'm no longer able to process support requests, bug reports and questions about release dates sent to me by e-mail. I'm really sorry about that but it's simply impossible to answer them all! Please refer to the forum or to the users mailing list for support. We also have a tracking system for bugs and feature requests. The direct e-mail (roundcube at gmail) is reserved for project management and development issues.

Thanks for your understanding.
