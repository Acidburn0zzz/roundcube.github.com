We just published a new release which fixes a recently reported XSS vulnerability as an update to the stable 0.5 branch. Please update your installations with this new version or patch them with the fix which is also published in the downloads section or our sourceforge.net page.

And stay tuned, 0.6-beta is on the way with lots of new features.
