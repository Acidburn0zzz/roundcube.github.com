We have now released the 0.1-rc1 package without any third party libraries. The package only contains the core source files which are all licensed under the Gnu GPL. This release is intended to be included in package repositories and server distributions that can handle dependencies. The complete list of dependencies can be found in the INSTALL file within the package.
