This service update brings some more bug fixes and stability improvements and it includes an updated version of the TinyMCE editor which is now supposed to work correctly in IE9.

It is considered stable and we recommend to update all existing Roundcube installation with this release. For a complete list of changes see [trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog)
