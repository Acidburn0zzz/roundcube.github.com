We're proud to announce the stable release of version 0.3 with the long-awaited plugin API. Now the doors are open to extend Roundcube's functionality and the integration in other web-based systems got much easier. The package includes a default set of useful plugins and some sample code. An introduction to plugin development can be found on our wiki at [trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Doc_Plugins](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Doc_Plugins) .

Together with this release we finally pimped our website with a fresh and sexy design created by Micha Krautwasser, a very talented screen designer at [bueroflint.com.](http://bueroflint.com.) Many thanks man!
