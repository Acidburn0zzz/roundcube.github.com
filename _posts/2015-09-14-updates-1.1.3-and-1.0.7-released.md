title: Updates 1.1.3 and 1.0.7 released
tags: releases updates
---

We just published updates to both stable versions 1.0 and 1.1
after fixing many minor bugs and ensuring compatibility with upstream 
versions of 3rd party libraries used in Roundcube. Version 1.0.7 comes 
with cherry-picked fixes from the more recent version to ensure proper 
long term support.

See the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
