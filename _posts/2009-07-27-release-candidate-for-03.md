After getting plenty of feedback for the plugin API which was published in version 0.3-beta we now released an almost-ready version of RoundCube. The reason why this not yet a stable release are some pervasive changes on the IMAP backend in order to improve performance. We'd like our dear users to extensively test this release candidate and submit errors to our bug tracker. The 0.3-stable release will follow soon...
