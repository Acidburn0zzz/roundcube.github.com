important bug fixes and security improvements backported from the master version.

* Fix vulnerability in handling of `mail()`'s 5th argument
* Fix XSS issue in href attribute on area tag
* Wash position:fixed style in HTML mail for better security

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](/download).
