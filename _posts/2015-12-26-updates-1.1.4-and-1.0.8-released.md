We just published updates to both stable versions 1.0 and 1.1 delivering 
important bug fixes one of which seals a potential path traversal 
vulnerability reported by [High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab](https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23283).

A second security improvement adds some measures against brute-force attacks. 
See the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog#RELEASE+1.1.4).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

If you prefer to patch your installation for the path traversal vulnerability 
only, you can find patches on our download mirrors for versions 
[1.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/roundcubemail/files/roundcubemail/1.0.8/), 
and [1.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/roundcubemail/files/roundcubemail/1.1.4/).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
