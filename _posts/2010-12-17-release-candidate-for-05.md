Our Christmas gift for 2010 is now available for download. We just published the release candidate package for the upcoming version 0.5 of Roundcube. It's now feature-complete with a new UI for the IMAP folder management and improved handling for mailing list headers.

Please download and test this latest release and let us know about things that need improvement. The final version will be ready soon and we already have big plans for 2011.
