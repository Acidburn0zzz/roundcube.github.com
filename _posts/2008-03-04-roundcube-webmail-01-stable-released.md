After more than two years of development we finally released the first stable version of RoundCube Webmail. It's not as feature rich as we'd like it to be but the released version is considered to run stable for a productive environment. Thanks to our users we fixed many bugs and added some nice new features. So go ahead and upgrade your installations now.

The TinyMCE-based HTML message composition is now included but should still be considered as experimental. Please also note that this is the last release that runs on PHP 4. As suggested by the GoPHP5 project RoundCube will be PHP 5 only in future versions.
