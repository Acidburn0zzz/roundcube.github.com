This service release includes more than 40 bug fixes, security improvements and completes some missing translations. We also added TNEF support to decode proprietary MS Outlook attachments (winmail.dat) and tuned the performance when displaying a message.

This release is considered stable and we recommend to upgrade all existing installations to this version.

Unfortunately there are still some translations waiting to be completed. See [translator.roundcube.net](http://translator.roundcube.net) for the current completeness status and feel free to translate the missing labels and messages. Please send the updated files packed in an archive to our developer mailing list.
