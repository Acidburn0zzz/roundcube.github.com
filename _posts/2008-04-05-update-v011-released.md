The first service update for RoundCube Webmail 0.1-stable is now available. It contains important bug fixes and updates of some incomplete localization files. We recommend to update all installations of 0.1-stable. Read the UPGRADING instructions to find out how to do this.

Note: this update is still compatible with PHP 4 but future releases will only run on PHP 5.
