This update release fixes the most important bugs of the 0.4 stable release such as the disappearing upload box or buggy SQL scripts. Further more support for format=flowed has been improved and some localization files have been completed.

We recommend to update all existing Roundcube installation with this release. For a complete list of changes see [trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog)
