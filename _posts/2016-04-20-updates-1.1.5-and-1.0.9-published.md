We just published updates to both stable versions 1.0 and 1.1 delivering 
important bug fixes and helps protecting Roundcube against more XSS and 
CSRF attacks. Version 1.1.5 also has two new plugin hooks integrated and 
version 1.0.9 comes with cherry-picked fixes from the more recent version 
to ensure proper long term support.

See the full changelog in the [wiki](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog#release-115)
and the selection for 1.0.9 on the [release page](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.0.9).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from Github via [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
