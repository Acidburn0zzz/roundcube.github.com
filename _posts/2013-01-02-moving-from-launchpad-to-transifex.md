I'd like to inform you that we now decided to switch from launchpad to Transifex to maintain the translations for Roundcube. You can find Roundcube on Transifex.com at [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/roundcube-webmail.](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/roundcube-webmail.)

For quality reasons it is set to limited access which means that translators have to apply to become a member of a translation team before they can actually start translating. So if you're interested in becoming a member for a certain language team, choose the language from the list and then click on &quot;Join team&quot; on the upper right part of the overview page.

We kindly invite everybody to help us to keeping the Roundcube localizations up-to-date.
