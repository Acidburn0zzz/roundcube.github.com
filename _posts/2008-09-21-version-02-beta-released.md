This new version comes with many fixed bugs and some new features like

* collapsable folder tree
* auto-detection of client language and timezone
* complete TinyMCE integration
* message flagging
* default imap folders configurable for each user/account
* import/export of address book contacts
* support for pspell and syslog.

It's considered as stable and we recommend to update existing installations of RoundCube. Please read the UPGRADING instructions for details. An update script will (hopefully) be included with the next version.
