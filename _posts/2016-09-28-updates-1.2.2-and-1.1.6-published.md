We just published updates to both stable versions 1.2 and 1.1 delivering 
important bug fixes and and again more improvements of the Enigma plugin 
introduced in version 1.2. Version 1.1.6 comes with cherry-picked fixes 
from the more recent version and improvements in contacts searching as well 
as a few localization fixes.

See the full changelog in the [wiki](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog#release-122)
and the selection for 1.1.6 on the [release page](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.1.6).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from GitHub via [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!
