tags: releases updates
---

We just published updates to both stable versions 1.0 and 1.1
after fixing many minor bugs and adding some security improvements
to the 1.1 release branch. Version 1.0.6 comes with cherry-picked
fixes from the more recent version to ensure proper long term support
especially in regards of security and compatibility.

The security-related fixes in particular are:

 - XSS vulnerability in _mbox argument
 - security improvement in contact photo handling
 - potential info disclosure from temp directory

See the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don't forget to backup your data before updating!

*And there's one more thing:* please support our crowdfunding campaign 
for [Roundcube Next](https://roundcu.be/next) either directly or by 
spreading the word about it. You're help is much appreciated!
