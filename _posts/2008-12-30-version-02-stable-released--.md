The second stable version of the RoundCube Webmail package completes unfinished work from the 0.2-beta release and comes up with about 80 bugfixes as well as some performance improvements. The upgrading process now became very easy with the integrated update script. It's runnable from the shell or from within the web-based installer. Read the UPGRADING instructions for details. 

This version is considered stable and we recommend to update existing installations of RoundCube.
